# Stock News Aggregator Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
A stock news aggregator that collects, processes, and analyzes financial news from multiple sources using TensorRT-LLM for efficient inference, MongoDB for data storage, and LangChain for semantic ranking and retrieval. Results are stored in Milvus for efficient similarity search.

## Implementation Plan

- [x] Configure Redis for caching
- [ ] Set up TensorRT-LLM environment

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- [x] Set up Django project structure
- [x] Configure Django settings and dependencies
- [x] Create news data models
- [x] Implement news data ingestion service
- [x] Set up Celery tasks for background processing
- [x] Implement news processing pipeline
- [x] Add data validation and cleaning
- [x] Set up API endpoints
- [x] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add rate limiting and caching

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [x] Set up React project structure
- [x] Create reusable components
- [x] Implement news feed interface
- [x] Add stock symbol search and filtering
- [x] Create user dashboard
- [ ] Implement real-time updates
- [x] Add data visualization components

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Implement unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement error handling and recovery

### Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create system architecture documentation
- [ ] Add deployment guides
- [ ] Create README.md
